# As of May 31, 2023, Box will no longer support Android SDK

We will no longer support Android SDK as of May 31, 2023. Customers will be able to use their existing Android SDK applications with no impact, but will not receive new features, updates, or bug fixes.
 

If you would like to continue getting the latest and greatest Android features, we recommend using Java SDK to build apps on Android. Refer to [this](https://github.com/box/box-java-sdk/blob/main/doc/android.md) documentation for more details.

Box Android Content SDK
===================

This SDK makes it easy to use Box's [Content API](https://box-content.readme.io/reference) in your Android projects.

Getting Started Docs: https://developer.box.com/guides/mobile/android/install/

Quickstart
----------
Step 1: Add the SDK to your project

The SDK can be obtained by adding it as a maven dependency, cloning the source into your project, or by downloading one of the precompiled JARs from the releases page on GitHub.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.box</groupId>
    <artifactId>box-android-sdk</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

This SDK has the following dependencies and will need to be included if you use the JAR:
* minimal-json v0.9.1 (for maven: com.eclipsesource.minimal-json:minimal-json:0.9.1)

Step 2: Set the Box Client ID, Client Secret, and Redirect URI(if set) that you obtain from [creating a developer account](http://developers.box.com/)
```java
BoxConfig.CLIENT_ID = "your-client-id";
BoxConfig.CLIENT_SECRET = "your-client-secret";
// must match the redirect_uri set in your developer account if one has been set. Redirect uri should not be of type file:// or content://.
BoxConfig.REDIRECT_URL = "your-redirect-uri";
```

Step 3: Authenticate a User
```java
// This will present the necessary UI for a user to authenticate into Box. 
// Pass in the current context.
BoxSession session = new BoxSession(MainActivity.this);
session.authenticate();
```

Sample App
----------
A sample app can be found in the [box-content-sample](box-content-sample) folder. The sample app demonstrates how to authenticate a user, view the user's files and folders, and upload a file.
